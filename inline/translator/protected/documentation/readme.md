Potential features:

- if we notice that the translation stuff is active and you have the permission
	-> load all translations that are currently available, otherwise you only see _exported_ translations which may not yet be fully up to date
- immediately load translations locally once you have created them
- allow easy language toggling and/or in situ visualization
